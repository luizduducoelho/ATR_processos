# multithreaded_IPC_system_in_windows
Program using threads, processes and Interprocess-Communication simulating an industry application

Project was build using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. Unlikely to run in any other platform. 
Here we use the win32 API to handle SO synchronization objects such as semaphores and events, as well as interprocess communication
and other thread specif functions. 
The goal is to have a distributed system working together in industry like application.
